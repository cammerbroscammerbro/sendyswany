Cipher QU — Landing page prototype

Files:
 - `dashbord.html` — landing page HTML
- `css/styles.css` — styles and layout
- `js/main.js` — animations: typing + background canvas
- `assets/logo.svg` — logo SVG

To open locally:
1. Open `dashbord.html` in a browser. No build step required.

Notes:
- The hero text types "Cipher QU", morphs into hashed-like variants and returns.
- Background uses a canvas for drifting tokens and fade-away particles.
- Try-it block is selectable for copy/paste.

Next steps (optional):
- Replace placeholder encrypted variants with a procedural scrambling animation.
- Add ARIA attributes and keyboard-focus styling for improved accessibility.
- Export as a small static site or integrate with your framework of choice.
